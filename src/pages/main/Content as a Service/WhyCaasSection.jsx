            The way brands create content has changed dramatically. What worked
            five years ago , a monthly campaign and a few social posts , is no
            longer enough. Today, content is the backbone of marketing, driving
            everything from brand awareness to lead generation and customer
            retention.

          <p className="font-semibold text-gray-900">But here’s the problem:</p>

          {/* Problems List */}
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-black/80">
            <li>In-house teams are often limited by bandwidth.</li>
            <li>Agencies can be too rigid or slow to respond.</li>
            <li>Freelancers may lack consistency and strategic alignment.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-secondary">
            This gap leaves businesses struggling to keep up with the speed and
            scale the digital landscape demands.

              Content as a Service (CaaS)

            solves this challenge by offering a flexible, scalable, and
            on-demand solution. Instead of being locked into static models,
            brands can produce exactly what they need, when they need it.
